<tr><td><p>This is my infographic project, I was allowed to choose and to create an infographic based on the CamCorder. I knew about the camcorder since its the staple for skateboarding. Its the only camera used for skate film, anywhere from thrasher to vans, basically any skateboarder company. I always loved skating and the culture around it, its one of my favorite hobbies. The biggest struggle for this assignment was researching it, the easiest and most favorite though was being able to use my artistic imagination to create the infographic.</p>
